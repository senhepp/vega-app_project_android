## Purpose of the work

The basic department maintains a large collection of information resources,
primarily scientific books and articles related to the interests of employees and students.
There was a need to organize and access these resources in a more user-friendly way.
As part of the research work, the task was set to create a cross-platform mobile application
to display a list of documents from the Vega's collection of information resources
and filter them by keyword if there is a sample of such an application on iOS
to expand the audience of department resources users.

## To-do

The task was to develop a cross-platform application based on the Flutter framework,
displaying and filtering a list of documents, which sends a request to the presented API,
receives information about stored documents as a response and displays a list of them on the application screen.
